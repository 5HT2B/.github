Currently the only available project published here is Heartbeat. Stay tuned for more in the future.

## Heartbeat: Getting Started.

- What is Heartbeat?

  It is a platform-agonistic service for showing a "last seen online" service, with support for multiple devices, and future planned support for several things (location; blood oxygen levels; heartrate; private / visiblity options).

- How do I use it?

  First you want to get a backend service up and running, as described in [`DOCS.md`](https://github.com/technically-functional/heartbeat/blob/master/DOCS.md).
  Next, you can setup your clients. Linux, macOS and Unix all have their instructions in [`heartbeat-unix`](https://github.com/technically-functional/heartbeat-unix). Android is described [here](https://github.com/technically-functional/heartbeat/blob/master/DOCS.md#running-client-on-android-tasker) with an Android app being currently in development.
